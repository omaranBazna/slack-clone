Slack App clone:

#In this project I cloned Slack App using React Js , firebase and Redux.

#For styling my project,I used CSS and material UI which enables me to add interactive icons really quickly with best quality.

#For the database ,I used firebase collections to store all the channels.

#For user authorization ,I used firebase Google provider.

#I used Redux Js for state management to made my app more reliable and testable.

#The App architecture is totally scalable and testable ,we can easily expand any new functionality like messages likes and threads.

#The code is well documented ,clean ,commented ,divide into separate modules and components and easy to understand.
